// Vendored simplify.js — Ramer–Douglas–Peucker + radial-distance polyline
// simplification. Used by the sketch adapter (adapters/sketch.js) to thin
// hand-drawn strokes before Chaikin smoothing, exactly as Jonathan Ward's
// fabmo-smoothsketch-app used it. Wrapped as an ES module (default export);
// the algorithm below is unmodified.

// Point format is { x, y } — the same shape seams regions use.
